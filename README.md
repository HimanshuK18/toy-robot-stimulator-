# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

How it works
• The robot is free to roam around the board via clicking the of Up, Down, Left and Right buttons or using 
 the keyboard arrow keys.
• A status bar should also frequently update to show the current position of the Robot.
• If the robot is at the edge of the board, it must be prevented from falling over.
• To start or reset the robot's position, it should be done via text box. The X, Y position and a 
  button to confirm.

The Image below shows the X,Y postion for reference.
